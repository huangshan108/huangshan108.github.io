		Hi everyone. I am Shan Huang. I am pursing a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and I am currently interning at Log(N), a tech company in San Francisco. <br><br>
		I like to work in a causal working environment which has more collaboration over competition. I think pressures and strict rules will prevent people from coming up with good ideas and create new fancy stuffs. And the company I am currently working with meets my preferences very well. The colleagues are very friendly, which makes me feel very comfortable working at that company.
