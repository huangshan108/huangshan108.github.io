					<p>The first day is pretty easy. I was told to catch up ruby on rails so I learned some basic ruby and am able to host a local database using ruby. The “Pingpong teams” in the company are awesome, lots of fun playing with them.</p>

					<p>Continue catching up ruby. Katie walked me through the Schoolmint website. I was assigned the first task, which is junit test the Schoolmint website. Manually tested the site functionality and found several bugs. I tested both parent site (qa.schoolmint.net) and admin site (dev.schoomint.net). It turns out that admin site is more complicated than I thought so just focus on the parent site for now.</p>

					It seems like some of my bugs fix does not work as it supposed to be, which fix one causes problems of the other. Thanks for Cristopher pointed me out and I will be more careful next time.

I also fixed a problem that causes the multi-school selections look terribly formatted.</p>

I also improved the user experience when filling forms and make the page jump to unfilled/required blanks automatically rather than do nothing. </p>

I also need to change the icons as well. Galen already requested the icon from design teams and once they come out with an icon I will update it (I already created a placeholder for the icon). I also update font-face/font-family to make sure our selected Avenir font in our font directory will be loaded by Firefox (Somehow Firefox might have a different font scheme and will not load our font, that why all the fonts in Firefox look like Times). I also update the language selector to make it display the language currently selected in the language in the selector to improve the visibility of our language selection option.</p>

I set everything up when it was in Mountain Lion and after I upgraded it to Mavericks everything I had before like rails, rake, mysql... started to do some weird things (gave me errors like file not found, do not have permissions, incompatible versions...). I spent a lot of time today to research on all these of error messages and tried to fix them.</p>

					<p>Today I mainly worked on some validation tasks. I fixed some bug when creating/changing passwords. Schoolmint used to give an error page when user creating/changing a invalid password (not enough length/ a password with all spaces in it… etc...). I fixed it by update the validator scheme and add custom validator to password creating/changing process and show inline warning messages to user when they use an invalid password rather than giving them an error page. I also update the phone number validator so that people much input phone number of 10 digits because all the American phone numbers are 10 digits or 7 without area code. To avoid people mistype their phone number in fewer digits and it is not quite make sense to enter a phone number without an area code here, I implemented and gave them a inline text warning to force them enter a phone number strictly in 10 digits. I also fix a UI problem which causes some long text to overflow the text boxes by hidden the longer part and show the full text when hovering mouse over it. Besides these, I also correct some typos and improved some coding styles.</p>

					<p>Today I continue working on bug fix. I fixed a bug which causes the clickable area of a button is incorrect. Then I started to work on the admin registration part. When a new admin/organization is signing up, they should be able to specify their organization domain url by themselves, not by us to manually type them in the database. So I created another row for user to input their preferred domain url and store them in the database. I also implement the domain checking validator. Now I just need some to implement a API for existing domain checking and I told to Victor and he already created a ticket for that.</p>

					<p>Today I created all the breadcrumbs and now they all do what they are supposed to do. I also did some css to make some longer texts initially fold and expand when mouse hover over them. Then I start to work on the page translation stuff. I tried to add support to Chinese. I modified the language scheme related files in both frontend and backend and it does not work very well. I think I need to do more researches on that one. Other than that, I started to work on automatically language detection of schoolmint site.</p>

					<p>Since the admin user list still looks not very well. I totally rearrange the layout of the template. Now the admin user list look much better and no emails will be cut off again. I also fixed some tiny message and translation errors. In the afternoon I mainly work on the language detection of schoolmint site. I implemented several features:<br>
						<ul>
							<li>
								For new sign up user: we do a browser language detection and set their preferred they change it.
							</li>
							<li>
								For a returning sign in user: we get their preferred language in our database and display the webpage in their preferred language. The language of sign in page will be determined by browsers’ language.
							</li>
							<li>
								Currently ONLY supports Spanish, everything else will be treated as English which is by default.
							</li>
							<li>
								User can change their language preference any time by switching languages.
							</li>
						</ul>

Now this feature is fully implemented and ready to test. I also updated the icon of school widget in create new application page, which is needed since we change the widget before.</p>

					<p>Due to Chrome’s different language detection scheme (will use systems language preference rather than browser’s), I found a walk around that will set the language of schoolmint site based on browser’s language preference by get the http header returned from the server.
